  Short description: manage multiple selections or cursor positions using only the keyboard.
  `ctrl+m` will make a mark. `ctrl+m` in another position will select the previous and add the
  new position.  `ctrl+shift+m` will add without selecting.  `alt+m` will select / jump to the
  next mark.  `ctrl+alt+m` to remove all marks.

  Trust me, very useful, especially in conjunction with the `TransposeCharacter` command.
