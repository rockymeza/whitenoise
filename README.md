The Strange Case of...
======================

It's yet another static site generator.  Have you seen (jekyll)[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll]?
(hyde)[http://ringce.com/hyde]?  Yup.  Like those.

But this one is:

1. Written in python, unlike `jekyll`
2. **NOT** complicated, unlike `hyde`.  And I mean *really* **NOT** complicated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, the complicated stuff.  This will hopefully make sense at the end.  I mention them
first so that you get an idea for the *most* complicated parts (which aren't really that
complicated)

* `config.yaml` files can contain a `files:` dictionary where the keys refer to a file in that folder, and
  the values are treated as yaml front matter.  This makes it possible to configure binary files.

* Index pages are not included when iterating over a folder.

* Index pages' URLs do not include the filename.  This means they have the same name
  as the folder they index.  That's good, right?


Now for the easy stuff!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, SO
-------


* `config.yaml` stores context variables.  It is merged with the default config (see below - it's simple, too!).

* Everything in your `config.yaml` files is available as a context variable.  `config.yaml` files in a folder
  are merged with the parent folder.

* `site/` stores site content - templates and assets.  These are processed or copied or ignored, as the case may be.

* `config.yaml` files in a folder within `site/` override settings in the parent folder.

* Template files (.html, .txt, .md) can contain YAML front matter.  If the first line is `^[-]{3,}$`, everything up
  to the matching dashes will be treated as YAML and added to that files context variables.

* Templates are processed using (jinja2)[http://jinja.pocoo.org/]

* Jinja is told only about your project folder, so you can use any directories you want
  to store layouts, macros, and partials.
  * layouts that are in `layouts/` are extended using `{% extends 'layouts/file.j2' %}`
  * includes can go in `anywhere/`, and then they are included using `{% include 'anywhere/file.j2' %}`
  * SO: only `site/` is special.

* For fun, you can prefix variables on a page with `my.` (e.g. `my.title` or `my.parent`). I think it looks
  better in some places because it makes it clear where the content comes from (e.g. `{{ my.title }}` as
  opposed to just `{{ title }}`).


DEFAULT/SPECIAL CONFIG
----------------------

``` yaml
  config_file: 'config.yaml'  # name of file that contains config
  host: "http://localhost:8000"  # hostname.  I'm not using this for anything, but I imagine it will be importand for pligin authors
  index: index.html  # any file whose target_name matches this name will not be iterable
  ignore: ['config.yaml', '.*']  # which files to ignore altogether
  dont_process: ['*.js', '*.css', *images]  # do not run these files through jinja
  rename_extensions: { '.j2': '.html', '.jinja2': '.html' }  # which extensions to rename
  html_extension: '.html'  # files with this extension are html files (`page.is_page` => `True`)
  # PROTECTED
  # these can only be assigned in the root config file
  site_path: 'site/'  # where to find site content
  deploy_path: 'public/'  # where to put the generated site
```


EXECUTING
---------

`$ python strange_case.py`

Goes through all the files and directories in `site/`

* Files/Folders that match `ignore` are skipped.
* Folders become `FolderNode` objects (`site/` is such a node).  Folders have children.
* Templates (any file that doesn't match `dont_process`) become `TemplatePageNode(PageNode)` objects
* Assets (anything that isn't a template) become `StaticPageNode(PageNode)` objects

Files can have metadata either as front matter, or in that folder's `config.yaml` in a `files:` entry.
The `files:` entry is so that static assets can have metadata.  Because of this, `files:` in the `config.yaml` files are not
copied or merged with child or parent settings.


These nodes are placed in a tree:

    (root, aka site)
    | static/
    | | css/
    | | + style.css
    | \ image/
    |   | img1.png
    |   | img2.png
    |   + img3.png
    | robots.txt
    | index (index.j2 => index.html)
    \ blogs/
      | test1 (test1.j2 => test1.html)
      + test2 (test2.j2 => test2.html)


TEMPLATES
---------

### In your templates, you have access to anything in the top-level config and in per-page metadata:

`/config.yaml`:

``` yaml
meta:
  author:
    name: "Colin"
```

`/site/index.html`:

``` jinja
---
# YAML front matter
title: test
---

<h1>{{ meta.author.name }}</h1>
<h2>{{ title }}</h2>
<h2>{{ my.title }}</h2>
```

=>

``` html
<h1>Colin</h1>
<h2>test</h2>
<h2>test</h2>
```


### You can iterate over folders:

``` jinja
{% for blog in site.blogs %}
<p>{{ loop.index }}. {{ blog.title }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

=>

``` html
<p>1. Blog Title</p>
<p>2. Blog Title</p>
```

** * Note: * ** Files named `index.html` will not be included in this list.  This is a
very reasonable design decision, but I can imagin a situation where you have a file (think
`robots.txt`) that *also* doesn't belong in the iterable pages list.  So `iterable: false` is
available as a config setting.


### Access any page by name:

``` jinja
{{ site.blogs.test1.url }}
```

In order to access pages this way, non-word characters are replaced by "_".  e.g. `-my.goofy-$-filename.txt` => `my_goofy___filename_txt`.

** * Note: * ** The .html extension is removed from html files, all other extensions are preserved (but `file.txt` => `file_txt`, as
explained above)


### Even iterate over static assets, since everything is a node!

``` jinja
{% for image in site.static.image %}
<img src="{{ image.url }}" />
{% endfor %}
```

You can check what kind of node you're working with using the `type` property ("page", "folder", "asset") or the `is_page`, `is_folder`, `is_asset` methods.

Lastly, the `.all()` method on folders is useful.  The method definition says it all I think:

``` python
def all(self, folders=False, pages=True, assets=False, recursive=False):
    """ Returns descendants, ignoring iterability. Folders, assets, and
    pages can all be included or excluded as the case demands."""
```


AND THAT'S IT
-------------

jinja2 makes it easy to put complicated logic in templates, which is really the only place for them in this static generator context...

...or is it !?  Iâ€™m wondering what kind of spaghetti nonsense these templates could end up with (it's like PHP all over again!), and how that could be fixed.


TODO
----

* Add page processors, so that you could build a categories index page based on pages' category metadata.
* Placing entries in `**/config.yaml` override parent configs, but i'd like to add a merging syntax to the YAML, as a little DSL.
