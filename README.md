The Strange Case...
===================

It's yet another static site generator.  Have you seen jekyll?  hyde?  Yup.  Like those.

But this one is:

1. Written in python, unlike `jekyll`
2. **NOT** complicated, unlike `hyde`.  and I mean *really* **NOT** complicated.


First, the complicated stuff:

* Index pages are not iterable, except by using `page.all()`
* Index pages' URLs do not include the filename.  This means they have the same name
  as the folder they index.  That's good, right?
* For fun, you can prefix variables on a page with `my.`
  I think it looks better, and `self` was taken.


Now for the easy stuff!


OK, SO
-------

* `config.yaml` stores context variables.
* `site/` stores site content - templates and assets.  These are processed or copied or ignored, as the case may be.
* `config.yaml` files in a folder within `site/` override settings in the parent folder.  config is merged with the default config (see below - it's simple, too!).
* `./` is the "root" afa template includes go:
  * layouts can go in `layouts/` and are extended using `{% extends 'layouts/file.j2' %}`
  * includes can go in `anywhere/` and are included using `{% include 'anywhere/file.j2' %}`
  * see? only `site/` is special.  everything else is up to you.


DEFAULT/SPECIAL CONFIG
----------------------

``` yaml
  host: "http://localhost:8000"  # hostname
  index: index.html  # any file whose target_name matches this name will not be iterable (by default)
  ignore: ['config.yaml', '.*']  # which files to ignore altogether
  dont_process: ['*.js', '*.css', *images]  # do not run these files through jinja
  rename_extensions: { '.j2': '.html', '.jinja2': '.html' }  # which extensions to rename
  html_extension: '.html'  # files with this extension are html files (`page.is_page` => `True`)
```


EXECUTING
---------

`$ python strange_case.py`

Goes through all the files and directories in `site/`

* Folders become `FolderNode` objects (`site/` is such a node).  Folders have children.
* Templates (jinja2 templates - or any text file) become `TemplatePageNode(PageNode)` objects
* Assets (css, js, images - anything that isn't a template) become `StaticPageNode(PageNode)` objects

Files can have metadata either as front matter, or in that folder's `config.yaml` in the parent folder, in a `files` entry.
The `files` is so that static assets can have metadata.  Because of this, `files:` in the `config.yaml` files are not
copied or merged with child or parent settings.  That's the only special config other than those above.


These nodes are placed in a tree:

    (root, aka site)
    | static/
    | | css/
    | | + style.css
    | \ image/
    |   | img1.png
    |   | img2.png
    |   + img3.png
    | robots.txt
    | index (index.j2 => index.html)
    \ blogs/
      | test1 (test1.j2 => test1.html)
      + test2 (test2.j2 => test2.html)


TEMPLATES
---------

### In your templates, you have access to anything in the top-level config and in per-page metadata:

`/config.yaml`:

``` yaml
meta:
  author:
    name: "Colin"
```

`/site/index.html`:

``` jinja
---
# YAML front matter
title: test
---

<h1>{{ meta.author.name }}</h1>
<h2>{{ title }}</h2>
```

=>

``` html
<h1>Colin</h1>
<h2>test</h2>
```


### You can iterate over folders:

``` jinja
{% for blog in site.blogs %}
<p>{{ loop.index }}. {{ blog.title }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

=>

``` html
<p>1. Blog Title</p>
<p>2. Blog Title</p>
```

** * Note: * ** Files named `index.html` will not be iterable by default.  This is a
*good thing* when making index.html files.  If you don't like it, set `iterable: true`
in your front matter.


### Access any page by name:

``` jinja
{{ site.blogs.test1.url }}
```

** * Note: * ** The .html extension is removed, but in order to have unique names, all other
file types have their extension added.

Also, in order to access pages this way, non-word characters are replaced by "_".  e.g. `-my.goofy-$-filename.txt` => `my_goofy___filename_txt`.

### Even iterate over static assets, everything is a node!

``` jinja
{% for image in site.static.image %}
<img src="{{ image.url }}" />
{% endfor %}
```

You can check what kind of node you're working with using the `type` property ("page", "folder", "asset") or the `is_page`, `is_folder`, `is_asset` methods.


AND THAT'S IT
-------------

jinja2 makes it easy to put complicated logic in templates, which is really the only place for them in this static generator context...

...or is it !?  Iâ€™m wondering what kind of spaghetti nonsense these templates could end up with (it's like PHP all over again!), and how that could be fixed.


TODO
----

* Add page processors, so that you could build a categories index page based on pages' category metadata.
* Placing entries in `**/config.yaml` override parent configs, but i'd like to add a merging syntax to the YAML, as a little DSL.
